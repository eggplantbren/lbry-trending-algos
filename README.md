lbry-trending-algos
===================

Various LBRY trending algorithms by me.
A (very brief) description of each is given in a comment at the top of each
`.py` file. If one of them eventually becomes important enough, I'll write it
up in a lot more detail.

Currently, lbry.tv uses `ar.py`, but I think `variable_decay.py` is the best
one, and they will be trying it out soon.

The file `desiderata.md` describes what we're trying to achieve.
