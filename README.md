lbry-trending-algos
===================

Various LBRY trending algorithms by me.
A (very brief) description of each is given in a comment at the top of each
`.py` file. If one of them eventually becomes important enough, I'll write it
up in a lot more detail.

The file `desiderata.md` describes what we're trying to achieve.

Currently, lbry.tv uses both `ar.py` and `variable_decay.py`, and they are
A/B testing them. However, I think `variable_decay.py` is the best one with
respect to the desiderata, even if it performs worse in terms of engagement.
